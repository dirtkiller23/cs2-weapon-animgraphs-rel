CS2 Weapon Animgraph releases
To get the vdata/animgraph resources to show up, you may need to unhide the resources in assettypes_common.txt (Remove the "csgo" from m_HideForRetailMods in both vdata_asset and anim_graph).
Create custom animgraphed weapons with ent_create custom_weaponname or compile the vdata_polygon map.
