CS2 Weapon Animgraph releases.
 To get the vdata/animgraph resources to show up, you may need to unhide the resources in assettypes_common.txt 
(Remove the "csgo" from m_HideForRetailMods in both vdata_asset and anim_graph). 
 Spawn custom animgraphed weapons with ent_create custom_weaponname or compile the vdata_polygon map.
 To edit animgraphs, you need the cutdown Dota 2 SDK with the Animgraph editor. Also includes decompiled weapon models.
