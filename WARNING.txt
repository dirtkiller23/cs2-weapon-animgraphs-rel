WARNING!
This mod now includes direct replacement of game's playermodel T/CT animsets.
If you know what you're doing, remove OFF from extensions vmdlOFF and vanmgrphOFF in:
content/xrd200_rel/characters/models/shared/animgraphs and content/xrd200_rel/characters/models/shared/animsets.
This will compile the animsets and force their usage over the in-game ones!
